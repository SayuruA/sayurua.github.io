I am a final year undergraduate student in the Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering department at the University of Moratuwa. I have a passion towards a set of very different fields, including NLP, performance-critical software, and wireless telecommunication.

I am currently working on training LLMs on privacy sensitive data in resource-constrained environments. This final year project explore the areas of split and federated learning in a scenario where the train data is distributed across multiple parties and each party has limited computational resources but sharing data is not possible due to privacy concerns. Me and my team are working on this project with Dr. [Kasun Hemachandra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RT8_dlYAAAAJ&hl=en) and profs. [Tharaka Samarasinghe](https://tharakas.staff.uom.lk/) and [Madushanka Liyanage](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p1n0ioUAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I worked as software engineering intern at [Paraqum Technologies](https://www.paraqum.com/) Pvt. Ltd. Sri Lanka. I have been working on their C++ infrastructure for high-performance network analysis software.

Currently I am in my final year of **Electronic and Telecommunications Engineering** department at the **University of Moratuwa**. My interests span a very different set of areas, including **natural language processing**, **performance-critical software**, and **wireless telecommunications**.


At the moment, I am mainly working on training **large language models on privacy-sensitive data in resource-constrained environments**. This final year project explore the areas of **split and federated learning** in a scenario where the training data is distributed across multiple parties, each with limited computational resources but sharing data is not an option due to privacy concerns.

This work is supervised by Dr. [Kasun Hemachandra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RT8_dlYAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Tharaka Samarasinghe](https://tharakas.staff.uom.lk/) and Prof. [Madushanka Liyanage](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p1n0ioUAAAAJ&hl=en).

I previously worked as a **Software Engineering Intern** at [Paraqum Technologies](https://www.paraqum.com/) Pvt. Ltd., Sri Lanka, where I contributed to **C++-based high-performance network analysis infrastructure**.
