I enjoy working on systems where performance, correctness, and real-world constraints matter.

I worked as part of an agile Scrum team focused on designing and implementing backend algorithms for **network analysis and monitoring tools**. My work primarily involved **performance-critical C++ systems**, with exposure to high-throughput packet processing and large-scale data analysis.

During this internship, I gained hands-on experience with **high-performance systems development**, using libraries such as **DPDK** and **FastBit**, and working close to the data plane.

One of my key contributions was proposing and developing a **detector for unencrypted network sessions** based on payload randomness analysis. This feature has since been integrated into  
**[*CeyAnalyst*](https://www.paraqum.com/products/ceyanalyst/)**.

I also modified a core module of the **[*Network Analyzer*](https://www.paraqum.com/products/network-analyzer/)** to adapt it for the newer product **[*Flow Analyzer*](https://www.paraqum.com/products/flowanalyzer/)**, which is now deployed in production.

Additional work included:
- Developing a customized `traceroute` utility for internal use
- Building Node.js APIs to interface with C++ backend modules
